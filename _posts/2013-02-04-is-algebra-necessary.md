title: Is Algebra Necessary?

This is a response to [an article][1] that was pretty popular [on HN][2] a while
back. It was popular on HN because everyone disagreed with it, but this is the
sort of thing that resonates with a lot of people, and I’m disturbed to see that
it was published in NYTimes.

6 million high school students seems like a possible estimate; there are 17.53
million high school students in the US according to [wolfram alpha][1]. However 2
million college freshmen sounds like a vast overestimate. The annual birthrate
is [4.29 million][2] and nowhere near all people attend college. Assume 3 million
college freshmen per year. 2/3 of college freshmen not understanding algebra is
ridiculous, not only is a much larger percentage than the ~30% of high school
students that don’t understand algebra, the expected percentage should be
smaller for college students, since there is a positive correlation between the
students that do not attend college and the students that do not understand
algebra. This clearly false figure also makes me doubt the validity of the high
school figure. Maybe the author just doesn’t understand the math?

5 hours a week of maths prevents developing young talent? If you’re willing to
say that, then isn’t the next logical conclusion is to say that 35 hours a week
of mandatory school also prevents developing talents. I doubt that many people
would sympathize with the notion that school prevents students’ from developing
talents.

And the solution is to make high school easier? This is like the way states
treat standardized tests. So that the state can report higher scores on
standardized tests for no child left behind, they make them painfully easy. Each
year, at least once, I spend 3 hours in a room, taking a test that in reality
takes only about 45 minutes, and which I could have passed with more than a 90%
before stepping foot in the class that it is evaluating me in, and forbidden
from doing anything other than sitting quietly and waiting after completing the
test, not even when everyone in the room, and even nearby rooms, has finished
(yes, I’m using this as an opportunity to complain). Making high school easier
so that more students pass is also like printing more currency so that people
have more money. It doesn’t actually give students more value, because even
though they passed high school, that achievement is now worth less. Education is
being inflated by jobs requiring more of it, let’s not inflate it more by
decreasing it’s value artificially.

Well, how many students? Is this mainly referring to students who are mentally
challenged or are more-or-less average but culturally or behaviorally inclined
to refuse to learn anything? Sadly the vast majority of these students are
destined to drop out _anyway_, and if they don’t, they are unlikely to succeed
in jobs that require a high school education (or rather jobs that _should_
require a high school education<sup>1</sup>)

Your school should teach math better. If more students are failing a course than
passing it, it should be obvious that the professor and the curriculum need to
be changed immediately. It is impossible that a competent professor would have
_that_ high of a failure rate, which makes the statistic irrelevant.

<sup>1</sup> but that’s not something to fix by making high school easier, it
should be done by somehow requiring employers to consider hiring burger flippers
without high school diplomas.
